# Joya 2

An eCommerce site created using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and JS. It's my attempt to learn and use tailwindCSS and mixing that with good Web design principles.  

## Setup

```bash
cd Joya2
npm install
```

```bash
npm install live-server -g # or use any other live server
live-server ./public
```
